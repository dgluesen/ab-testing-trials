This means that there are two groups of generally speaking customers who are presented different versions of a certain product, presentation or similar between the groups. Customer behavior is then compared in terms of a success metric, such as signing a contract, purchasing or providing contact information. As a result, the provider or operator receives a clear decision support as to which version should be implemented for the future in order to maximize the addressed success. In the following the basics will be worked out and some simple examples will be calculated. The central question will be whether the observed difference between the groups can be described as **significant**. For this purpose, the **t-** respectively **Welch-test** will be introduced."

    "If the comparison of two groups shows a difference in the measurable quantity, we want to know whether this difference is due to group membership or whether it is random. To stay with an example from the introduction: Is a higher turnover achieved with the red button due to the color of the button or is this difference to the blue button purely coincidental. To answer this question, hypotheses are formulated. The so-called **null hypothesis** describes the case that we want to reject on the basis of our experiment: The expected values of the measured variable are actually the same $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu$ because both samples are from the same population, although the sample means are different $\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2$. The statement disjoint to the null hypothesis is the **alternative hypothesis**. In this case it can be assumed that the samples are taken from different distributions with different expected values $\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$ with respect to the measurand. Hence, it explains the difference between the empirical sample means $\\bar{x}_1 \\neq \\bar{x}_2$. The following chart is explaining these cases with samples from the same distribution on the left hand side and two different distributions with two different expected values on the right hand side."

    "**Pretended case:** In a wholesale company there are two groups of customers: professional HoReCa which are hotels, restaurant owners, and caterers (hereafter also called <span style=\"color:#003f7e\">blue group</span>) and retail customers (hereafter also called <span style=\"color:#821626\">red group</span>). The respective group is assigned a separate entrance to the stores. All other conditions are the same, such as prices, service levels etc. It should be checked whether the different entrances lead to different sales figures in the departments.\n",

    "With the exception of the delicatessen sector, the p-value for all other products is below the significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. We therefore reject the null hypothesis for these segments and note that the argument that the difference in sales is due to the change in market access has been supported. For delicatessen $p \\approx 0.169$ is above our defined $\\alpha$, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Our initial question (Does the different entrance to the market cause a different buying behavior and if so, which positioning of the entrance is sales-promoting?) has to be answered in different ways for the different products:\n",
    "* For Fresh and Frozen the market entry of the <span style=\"color:#003f7e\">channel-1 group</span> seems to be sales-promoting, because there is statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "* For Milk, Grocery as well as Detergents and paper the entrance of the <span style=\"color:#821626\">channel-2 group</span> is likely to be boosting sales, due to a justified rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "* For the Delicatessen segment there are no indications that the specific entrance is of relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The store managers must now be challenged with this result. Depending on the strategic orientation (sales targets in the segments, etc.) a profound decision regarding market access can be made."
